This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP related to type juggling.  The `calculateSum` function is intended to sum an array of numbers. However, the presence of a string value within the array leads to unexpected behavior because PHP implicitly converts the string to a number during the addition operation. This can lead to incorrect results and hard-to-debug issues. The solution provides a robust method to handle this type of error.
